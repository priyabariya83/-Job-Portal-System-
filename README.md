# -Job-Portal-System-
Job Portal System is a console-based application built using only Core Java. It simulates real-world job recruitment by allowing users to register, post jobs, apply for jobs, and view applications through a simple menu-driven interface. The project runs entirely in Notepad and Command Prompt, with no external libraries or frameworks.
